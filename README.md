How to RUN the map generating script
----------------------------------------
1. Clone the repo using the link on the right.
 * Use this command to clone the repo: __git clone *"link on your right"*__.
 * If you're using github app with GUI, I'm afraid you'll have to figure it out youslef, since I have no idea how to clone repo without command line. 
2. Run print_pdfs.R. 
 * Use this command to run the script: __Rscript print_pdfs.R__
 * It should check and install depended package if not installed already.
 * It should create a /data folder in the cloned folder.
 * It pulls raw data from Dropbox and print pdfs to Dropbox.
3. Reach out to Zaiming, in case you have trouble runing the script.
